# Python-api-challenge
In this challenge we had to use Apis to extract data from citipy Python Library and OpenWeatherMap to extract the data to create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator.
Using OpenWeatherMap API weather data was obtained and appended to the cities list from citipy Python Library which was the used to create a dataframe.
This dataframe was then used to plot scatter graphs to visualise and analyse the different relationships between Latitude and other weather factors.
Linear regression was the performed on each relatonship for further analysis.

The second part of this challenge required that a plan is made for future vacation using weather data. With the help of geopify a map was plotted that displays Hotel accomodation in different cities taking into consideration an ideal temperation of between 18C to 25C, wind speed of 4.5 and cloudiness of 10 or less.
